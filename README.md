# GeekJokes
This is a simple front-end that fetches jokes via The Random Geek Jokes REST API. The Geek Jokes API includes browser-friendly CORS headers, and requires no API Key. As a result the architecture is pretty simple: everything happens between the browser and the API directly, without the need for NodeJS nor any backend scripting.
